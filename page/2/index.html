<h2 id="Solution"><a href="#Solution" class="headerlink" title="Solution"></a>Solution</h2><p>The warning can be generated by many reasons but 99% of the times, Operating system is re-installed on the remote server that will change its identity, and your <strong>local server has an old identity of your remote server</strong>.</p>
<p>To solve the issue, Just execute <code>user@locahost:~$ ssh-keygen -R REMOTE_HOST</code> on client-server.<br>This command remove the old remote host identity from the known_hosts file.</p>
