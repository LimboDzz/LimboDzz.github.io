## Problem

~~I splitted my vscode editor into upper and lower parts to respectively host my reference and the code I was working on, but found it really annoying that I had to, from time to time, use my mouse to change the focused editor.~~

See the title.

## Solution

^K^S to open Keyboard Shortcuts and search for "editor group".
I change the keybindings for "**View: Focus Above/Below/Left/Right Editor Group**" to "**Ctrl+Alt+Arrow Up/Down/Left/Right**".
