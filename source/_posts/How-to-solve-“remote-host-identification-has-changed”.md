## Problem

Met this warning when I tried to connect to AWS Lightsail using `ssh -i key.pem username@ipAddress`

```sh
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
@    WARNING: REMOTE HOST IDENTIFICATION HAS CHANGED!     @
@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@@
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SOMEONE IS DOING SOMETHING NASTY!
Someone could be eavesdropping on you right now (man-in-the-middle attack)!
It is also possible that the RSA host key has just been changed.
The fingerprint for the RSA key sent by the remote host is
3d:1b:02:9e:b2:b8:f0:f7:c6:4f:94:96:f6:e3:c0:d1.
Please contact your system administrator.
Add correct host key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts to get rid of this message.
Offending key in /root/.ssh/known_hosts:8
RSA host key for HOST has changed and you have requested strict checking.Host key verification failed.
```

## Solution

The warning can be generated by many reasons but 99% of the times, Operating system is re-installed on the remote server that will change its identity, and your **local server has an old identity of your remote server**.

To solve the issue, Just execute `user@locahost:~$ ssh-keygen -R REMOTE_HOST` on client-server.
This command remove the old remote host identity from the known_hosts file.
