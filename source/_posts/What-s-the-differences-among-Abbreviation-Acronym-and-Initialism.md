All three are shortened version of words and phrases. But **Acronyms** form new words. **Initialism** simple takes out the initials. Others are grouped into **Abbr**.

| Acronyms (form new words) | Abbreviation | Initialism (pronounce each letter) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| radar (radio detection and ranging) | St. (Street) | ATM (automated teller machine) |
| gif (graphics interchange format) | Ex. (example) | FAQ (frequently asked questions) |
| ZIP code (zone improvement plan) | Dec. (December) | a/c (air conditioning) |
